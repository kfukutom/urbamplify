# Urbamplify

Urbamplify is a full-stack platform designed to explore and define the concept of `urban tech`. It provides a free, data-driven consultation service for users by leveraging computational social science methodologies and advanced spatial analytics. The platform evaluates key factors such as infrastructure, economic conditions, and demographic data to generate neighborhood-level insights, assisting users in making informed decisions about business ventures.

## Project Objectives

This project represents an application of computational tools and software development principles to the study of urban systems. The key objectives are:

- Develop a structured **design hierarchy** to ensure intuitive navigation and usability.
- Enhance the **user interface (UI)** for seamless interaction and data visualization.
- Implement **agent-based modeling** to simulate urban environments, focusing on Manhattan, New York City.
- Apply **network analysis** concepts such as eigenvector centrality to evaluate neighborhood competitiveness.
- Explore **reinforcement learning** for optimizing recommendations based on user input.
- Integrate **Mapbox API** and **Google Places API** for mapping and location-based services.

This work also incorporates proficiency development in modern front-end technologies such as **React**, **React Native**, and **CSS**, alongside advanced visualization techniques using **D3.js**.

## Research Context

Urban technology (urban tech) is an emerging interdisciplinary field that combines computational tools, social science methods, and urban studies to address challenges in urban environments. This project applies tools such as Python's **NetworkX** and **OSMnx** to analyze the spatial and network properties of urban areas. By focusing on Manhattan, Urbamplify provides a framework for evaluating urban neighborhoods based on quantitative metrics, such as a calculated **livelihood score**, that reflect infrastructure quality, economic potential, and demographic alignment.

Users can input financial details to simulate potential returns, offering actionable insights for business planning and urban policy development.
